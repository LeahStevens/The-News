        <h4>Obama asks Congress to OK strike on Syria</h4>
<!-- Change article ipsum-->
       <p> But what we know - what we have seen - is that America can change. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p>

<p>Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. To the Joshua generation, these challenges seem momentous - and they are. Like other black churches, Trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. It was Islam - at places like Al-Azhar University - that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk.</p>

<p>John Kerry believes in America. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change. We can do that. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld - whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.</p>

<p>Today there are 12 million undocumented immigrants in America, most of them working in our communities, attending our churches, and contributing to our country. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. America, our work will not be easy. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.<p>

<p>They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. And he does not bring up a specific issue. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children. No single nation should pick and choose which nations hold nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>What is that promise? The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. Now, that must be our work here on Earth.</p>

<p>I'm hearing from progressives who understand that if we want to communicate our hopes and values to Americans, we can't abandon the field of religious discourse. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. America, we cannot turn back. And when the first Muslim-American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers - Thomas Jefferson - kept in his personal library.</p>

<p>I was too young to be involved in that movement, but I felt I could play a small part in the continuing battle for justice by helping rebuild some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity one day and affirm my Christian faith. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: "I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be." Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. No matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who hold power: you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party.</p>

<p>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. This bond is unbreakable. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well-educated are far more likely to be prosperous.</p>

<p>It's that folks are hungry for change - they're hungry for something new. So one Sunday, I put on one of the few clean jackets I had, and went over to Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street on the South Side of Chicago. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution - a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p>

<p>God bless you.</p>

      <h2>Author's Bio</h2>
      <p>Corporations are people too, my friend. I'll stand by what I said... whatever it was. I'm running for office for Pete's sake... I can't have illegals. We use Ann sparingly right now so people don't get tired of her. I purchased a gun when I was a young man. My net worth? It's somewhere between 150 and about 200-and-some odd million dollars. I think that's what the estimates are. They brought us binders full of women. No one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate. That's the America I love. I'm not concerned about the very poor. My job is not to worry about those people. I don't even consider myself wealthy.</p>

      That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Happy Franklin Friday. So did you see the new Poof? So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!

      She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. You're blowing my mind, Frank.

      I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. Turn this skiff around! There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out.
