        <h4>France Declares National Party Month a Sacred Institution</h4>
<!-- Change article ipsum-->
        <p>This is glass grade. I mean, you got... Jesus, you got crystals in here 2 inches, 3 inches long. This is pure glass. You're a damn artist! This is art, Mr. White! Yeah, that's the thing, y'know? Your scumbag brother-in-law took my rainy day fund. Oh yeah. And tell that douche bag brother-in-law of yours to go towards the light.   </p>

        <p>Got something for me? Is this a five or an S? Jesus, how the hell do you spell street wrong - S T R E A T? Spooge. Not mad dog, not diesel... let me get this straight, you got jacked by a guy named Spooge?  </p>

        <p>Where's my money... bitch? WHERE'S my money. Where's my. Where's MY money, bitch? Huh? Bitch? Where's my money, bitch? Oh that's good... where's my money. Where's my money, bitch. Bitch, where's my money. I will mess you... up. That how you wanna play this?  Huh, Your call, your funeral Jack. Hey, do not mess with me I will bury you cause I'm crazy. You know, yeah... mucho loco. Do not... test me.  </p>

        <p>Where's my money, bitch?! I ain't gonna keep asking nice. Yo, alright? I want my money and my dope. Come on! What, what! What do you wanna say? Shut up! Shut... up!  </p>

        <p>You didn't actually see Tuco? You got this money from Tuco? Tuco gave you this is what you're saying? You made a deal? How... why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me? No way man, okay, no understanding! Without even talking to me, you told this... insane ass-clown, dead-eyed killer, that uh... that we would give him two pounds a week? </p>

        <p>Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring it to us? God it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to Las Cruces, two hundred miles each way to meet up with my Smurfs. The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe only good for, like a half pound worth. See that's the bottle neck in your brilliant business plan. Of course you would've known that if you would've just asked me. </p>

        <p>At first I thought to myself 'Hell yeah, bitch. Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.' I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but... it was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked. He was just asking me honestly, 'Is that all you got?' And for some reason, I thought to myself: 'Yeah, man, I can do better.' </p>

        <p>So I started from scratch. I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box number five, I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane. I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood. It was fitted with pegs, no screws, I sanded it for days, until it was smooth as glass. Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark. It even smelled good. You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was... it was perfect. </p>

      That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Happy Franklin Friday. So did you see the new Poof? So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!

      It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. Those are balls. Everybody dance NOW. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "F**k Mountain."

      She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. You're blowing my mind, Frank.

      It's ok. You be with Yam. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. I'm sure Egg is a great person. So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! Say goodbye to THESE!

      Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.

      I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. Turn this skiff around! There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out.
